📊 Road Accident Analysis in R
This project uses R programming to analyze and visualize road accident data for uncovering trends, patterns, and high-risk zones. Using powerful R libraries like dplyr for data wrangling, ggplot2 for visualizations, and leaflet for interactive accident maps, the system provides deep insights into the causes and frequency of accidents by location, time, vehicle type, and weather. The goal is to support smarter traffic planning, public awareness, and road safety policies through data storytelling and evidence-based decisions. This analysis is ideal for urban planning teams, safety researchers, and transport authorities.
